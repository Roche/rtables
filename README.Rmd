# rtables

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Roche/rtables.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Roche/rtables/)


## Reporting tables with R

The `rtables` R package was designed to create and display complex tables with R. The cells in an `rtable` may contain
any high-dimensional data structure which can then be displayed with cell-specific formatting instructions. Currently,
`rtables` can be outputted in `ascii` and `html`.

Note: we have completely refactored the `rtables` package and officially released as per January 2021. If you have
learned the pre-2021 `rtables` framework then please spend some time familiarizing yourself with the new framework,
there is details in the vignettes.

`rtables` is developed on copy right by `F. Hoffmann-La Roche` and it is released open source under the Apache License
Version 2 to further the adoption of R and to spawn collaboration in the space of clinical trials data analysis and
reporting.

An important driver for writing `rtables` was to create regulatory submissions ready tables for the health authorities. Hence, summarized the requirements:

* cell values and their visualization separate (i.e. no string based tables)
* multiple values displayed within a cell
* values need to be programmatically accessible in their non-rounded state for cross-checking
* flexible formatting (cell spans, rounding, alignment, etc.)
* composition of an `rtable` object from other `rtables` objects
* multiple output formats (html, ascii, latex, pdf, xml)
* flexible pagination
* distinguish between name and label in the data structure to work with CDISC standards
* title, footnotes, cell cell/row/column references
* flexible tabulation framework

Note that the current state of `rtables` does not fulfill all of those requirements, however, `rtables` is still under
active development and we are working on adding the missing features.


## Installation

`rtables` is now available on CRAN and you can install the latest released version with:

```r
install.packages("rtables")
```

or you can install the latest stable version directly from GitHub with:

```r
devtool::install_github("Roche/rtables")
```

To install a frozen pre-release version of `rtables` based on the new Layouting and Tabulation API as presented at
user!2020 and JSM2020 run the following command in `R`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("roche/rtables", ref="v0.3.2.3")
```

To install the latest development version of the new test version of `rtables` run

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("roche/rtables", ref = "gabe_tabletree_work")
```


## Usage

We first begin with a demographic table alike example and then show the creation of a more complex table.


```{r}
library(rtables)

lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  analyze(c("AGE", "BMRKR1", "BMRKR2"), function(x, ...) {
    if (is.numeric(x)) {
      in_rows(
        "Mean (sd)" = c(mean(x), sd(x)),
        "Median" = median(x),
        "Min - Max" = range(x),
        .formats = c("xx.xx (xx.xx)", "xx.xx", "xx.xx - xx.xx")
      )
    } else if (is.factor(x) || is.character(x)) {
      in_rows(.list = list_wrap_x(table)(x))
    } else {
      stop("type not supproted")
    }
  })

build_table(lyt, ex_adsl)
```


```{r}
library(rtables)
library(dplyr)

## for simplicity grab non-sparse subset
ADSL = ex_adsl %>% filter(RACE %in% levels(RACE)[1:3])

biomarker_ave = function(x, ...) {
     val = if(length(x) > 0) round(mean(x), 2) else "no data"
     in_rows(
        "Biomarker 1 (mean)" = rcell(val)
     )
}

basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  split_cols_by("BMRKR2") %>%
  add_colcounts() %>%
  split_rows_by("RACE", split_fun = trim_levels_in_group("SEX")) %>%
  split_rows_by("SEX") %>%
  summarize_row_groups() %>%
  analyze("BMRKR1", biomarker_ave) %>%
  build_table(ADSL)
```
