# rtables

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Roche/rtables.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Roche/rtables/)


## Reporting tables with R

The `rtables` R package is a prototype to create and display complex tables with
R. The cells in an `rtable` may contain any high-dimensional data structure
which can then be displayed with cell-specific formatting instructions. Currently,
`rtables` can be outputted in `ascii` and `html`.

Some of our requirements and reasons to create this new table package are:

* multiple values displayed within a cell
* values need to be programmatically accessible for cross-checking
* flexible formatting (cell spans, rounding, alignment, etc.)
* composition of an `rtable` object from other rtable objects
* multiple output formats (html, ascii, latex, pdf)
* flexible pagination

Note that the current state of `rtables` does not fulfill all of those
requirements. We are looking for collaborators, see the next section.

## Collaboration and Planned API Changes

The current state of the `rtables` functionality is a first rough prototype. We
will be changing the API significantly in the coming months without maintaining
backward compatibility. We will release the `rtable` package on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) once we have a stable version.

We are looking for collaborators to help define and shape the `rtables` package.
Please [contact me](mailto:adrian.waddell@roche.com) if you would like to align
your contributions to the current development plans or feel free to fork the
repository and to send us pull requests with the suggested improvements.


## Installation

To install the stable release of `rtables` package run the following command in `R`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("roche/rtables", ref="v0.1.1")
```

To install the test version of `rtables` run

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("roche/rtables")
```


## Usage

```{r}
library(rtables)

tbl <- rtable(
  header = c("Treatement\nN=100", "Comparison\nN=300"),
  format = "xx (xx.xx%)",
  rrow("A", c(104, .2), c(100, .4)),
  rrow("B", c(23, .4), c(43, .5)),
  rrow(),
  rrow("this is a very long section header"),
  rrow("estimate", rcell(55.23, "xx.xx", colspan = 2)),
  rrow("95% CI", indent = 1, rcell(c(44.8, 67.4), format = "(xx.x, xx.x)", colspan = 2))
)
tbl
```
